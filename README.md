# Overview Repo - SMART on FHIR Apps

SMART apps are an infrastructure convention for delpoying apps in combination with FHIR webservices and a dedicated oauth server.

They rely on a connection library (e.g. fhir-client.js) to take care of all the fhir and oauth interactions.

website: http://docs.smarthealthit.org/

as the website describes it:

"SMART on FHIR is a set of open specifications to integrate apps with Electronic Health Records, portals, Health Information Exchanges, and other Health IT systems. You getâ€¦ FHIR, OAuth2, OpenID Connect, HTML5"

This repo contains example apps from fhir and eventually our own basic example app, which allows an easier introduction to the fhir app infrastructure


# Note the Installer - (why we dont use it)

The Smart on fhir group also provides an installer (https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/installer), however in order to integrate the individual components with our environment (docker based rather than virtual machine based) of this Development repository we take single bits of their repos.

# The SMART Apps

This Repo contains 4 smart apps taken from the installer repository, one of which has been configured to run properly.

However the Apps do not seem to follow a clear structure or use a specific framework, further the examples already have a fair amount of complexity, this is why we will provide our own simple working example in a useful framework, which will make implementing future apps a lot quicker.

# Smart example App

The smart app growth-chart in the example_apps folder works already, to try it do the following:

1. Navigate to example_apps/growth-chart and type the following in your console

```
npm install
npm start
```

go to your browser of choice and paste the following url:

http://localhost:9000/launch.html?fhirServiceUrl=http://gruendner.de:8080/gtfhir/base&patientId=1

logic of url

<baseurl of app host>/launch.html?fhirServiceUrl=<url of chosen fhir server api base (usually url/base)>&patientId=<id of chosen patient>

this accesses our gtfhir server and throws an error.
In your browser open your Console and check - you can see a 400 - not found error as the resource "FamilyMemberHistory" is not available on our server - however it shows that the communication works
